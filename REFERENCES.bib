Stem taper variability between two ecozones (i.e., Boreal Shield and Boreal Plains) were tested using the F-test. Regional differences were observed for trembling aspen, white spruce, and jack pine, and for those species, separate ecozone-specific taper equations were developed. However, the gross total volume estimates using the ecozone-specific equations were different from those of the provincial equations by only 2 percent. Although the regional difference in stem form was marginal within a province, a difference of approximately 7 percent of gross total volume estimation was found when our provincial taper equations were compared with those developed in Alberta and Saskatchewan. These results suggest that stem form variation increases with spatial scale and that a single taper equation for each species may be sufficient for each province.},

  abstract = {The estimation of aboveground biomass density (organic dry mass per unit area) is required for balancing Canadian national forest carbon budgets. Tree biomass equations are the basic tool for converting inventory plot data into biomass density. New sets of national tree biomass equations have therefore been produced from archival biomass data collected at the beginning of the 1980s through the ENergy from the FORest research program (ENFOR) of the Canadian Forest Service. Since the sampling plan was not standardized among provinces and territories, data had to be harmonized before any biomass equation could be considered at the national level. Two features characterize the new equations: estimated biomass of the compartments (foliage, branch, wood, and bark) are constrained to equal the total biomass, and dependence among error terms for the considered compartments of the same tree is taken into account in the estimates of both the model parameters and the variance prediction. The estimation method known to economists as "seemingly unrelated regression" allowed the inclusion of dependencies among the error terms of the considered biomass compartments. Sets of equations based on diameter at breast height (dbh) and on dbh and height have been produced for 33 species, groups of hardwood and softwood, and for all species combined. Biomass predicted by the new equations was compared with that estimated from provincial equations to evaluate the loss of accuracy when scaling up from the regional to the national scale. Bias and error of prediction from the set of national equations based on dbh and height were generally more similar to those from provincial equations than to those of predictions from the set of equations based on dbh alone. {\copyright} 2005 NRC.},

  abstract = {We have adjusted two growth and yield models to temporary sample plots from across Canada, and used climate variables in lieu of phytometric indices such as site index to represent, in part, the site-level variability in growth potential. Comparison of predicted increments in plot-level height, basal area and merchantable wood volume to increments of these variables measured in permanent sample plots shows a moderate to poor predictive ability. Comparison with the performance of four operational growth and yield models from different provinces across Canada shows comparable predictive power of this new model versus that of the provincial models. Based on these results, we suggest that the simplification of regional growth and yield models may be achieved without further loss of predictive power, and that the large error in the prediction of growth increment is mostly associated with the use of temporary sample plots which, by definition, contain little information on stand dynamics. We also suggest that, because of the empirical nature of these growth and yield models, the scale of application should determine the appropriate scale of the model. National estimates of forest growth are therefore less likely to be biased if obtained from a national model only than if obtained from a combination of regional models, where those exist, gap-filled with estimates from a national model. Key words: yield model, merchantable wood volume, stand age, climatic variables, simultaneous regression, robust regression},

A taper equation based on the dimensional analysis approach was adopted to fit Canadian national taper models using the collected data. The model parameters were estimated using a mixed model for taking into account variance heterogeneity and within- tree autocorrelation. In spite of the different protocols for data collection, the accuracy of the proposed stem taper models is similar to that found in previous studies. Consequently, the models seem suitable for pre-harvest estimation of sawlog volume nationally or regionally.},
