\title{Carmean and Hahn (1981) site index model}
\usage{
si_carmeanhahn1981(age, height = NULL, si = NULL, species)
}
\arguments{
\item{age}{Numeric vector. Total age (years).}

\item{height}{Optional numeric vector. Total tree height (m). If provided, `si` is predicted.}

\item{si}{Optional numeric vector. Site index (m, base age 50 years at total age). If provided, `height` is predicted.}

\item{species}{Character vector of species codes (e.g., `"ABIE.BAL"`).}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns:
\describe{
  \item{height}{Predicted height (m), returned when input `si` is provided.}
  \item{si}{Predicted site index (m), returned when input `height` is provided.}
}
}
\description{
Unified, vectorized implementation of the Carmean and Hahn (1981)
site-index equations for Lake States balsam fir and white spruce.
}
\details{
\strong{Model scope (species coverage):} this implementation includes
parameter sets for 2 species: \code{ABIE.BAL, PICE.GLA}.

\strong{Geographic use:} this model was fit to revised Lake States
harmonized curves and should be used with caution outside that domain.

\strong{Age definition note:} `age` is \emph{total age} (years), not
breast-height age.

\strong{Base-age note:} site index in this model is total height at
50 years total age.

Provide exactly one of `height` or `si`:
\itemize{
  \item If `height` is provided, the function predicts `si`.
  \item If `si` is provided, the function predicts `height`.
}

Inputs/outputs are metric; the original equations are in imperial units, so
the function converts internally.
}
\examples{
# Predict site index from age + height
si_carmeanhahn1981(
  age = c(30, 50, 70),
  height = c(8, 15, 22),
  species = c("ABIE.BAL", "ABIE.BAL", "PICE.GLA")
)

# Predict height from age + site index
si_carmeanhahn1981(
  age = c(30, 50, 70),
  si = c(12, 16, 20),
  species = c("ABIE.BAL", "ABIE.BAL", "PICE.GLA")
)
