\title{Nigh (2000) growth-intercept site index model for interior western redcedar}
\usage{
si_nigh2000_gi(age, gi)
}
\arguments{
\item{age}{Numeric vector. Breast-height age (years), expected in [1, 50].}

\item{gi}{Numeric vector. Growth intercept (cm/year).}
}
\value{
A tibble with one column:
\describe{
  \item{si}{Predicted site index (m, base age 50 years at breast height).}
}
}
\description{
Implementation of the Nigh (2000) growth-intercept model for
interior western redcedar (\code{THUJ.PLI}).
}
\details{
The model form is age-specific:
\deqn{SI = 1.3 + b_0(A)\times GI^{b_1(A)}}
where `A` is breast-height age (1 to 50) and `GI` is growth intercept
(cm/year).
}
\examples{
si_nigh2000_gi(
  age = c(5, 15, 30, 45),
  gi = c(12, 8, 6, 5)
)
