The `CanadaForestAllometry` package implements the national volume-to-biomass conversion models developed by @Boudewyn2007, which allow to translate between merchantable stem volume and aboveground biomass components. These models were designed to enable consistent large-scale biomass estimation in situations where inventory systems report volume rather than directly measured biomass. The @Boudewyn2007 approach combines species- and ecozone-specific conversion factors with empirically derived component allocation equations to estimate stemwood, bark, branches, and foliage biomass from merchantable volume. The functions use the updated model parameters available at https://nfi.nfis.org/en/biomass_models. 

- `v2b()` - converts merchantable volume to biomass components
- `vol_total_to_merchantable()` - converts total volume to merchantable volume
- `agb_component_proportions()` - calculates component proportions (stemwood, bark, branches, foliage) using either merchantable volume or total aboveground biomass as input
