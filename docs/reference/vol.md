# Calculate tree volume: choose best available model or run all candidate models

\`vol()\` is the main convenience wrapper for estimating total and
merchantable stem volume from diameter and height. It automatically
selects and runs one (or more) of the volume models implemented in
CanadaForestAllometry, based on the model registry returned by
\[volume_model_registry()\].

## Usage

``` r
vol(
  DBH,
  height = NA_real_,
  species,
  jurisdiction,
  subregion = NA_character_,
  pick_best = TRUE,
  keep_model_id = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- DBH:

  Numeric vector. Diameter at breast height (cm).

- height:

  Numeric vector. Total height (m). Can be \`NA\` to use the DBH-only
  models (currently only \`vol_ung2013()\`).

- species:

  Character vector. Species codes (e.g., "PICE.GLA").

- jurisdiction:

  Character scalar or vector. Province/territory code (e.g., "BC",
  "QC").

- subregion:

  Optional character vector. Subregion identifier (e.g., BEC zone for
  \`vol_kozak94()\`).

- pick_best:

  Logical. If \`TRUE\` (default), pick the single best model per tree
  using \`rank\`. If \`FALSE\`, compute all candidate model outputs per
  tree and return a list-column (one tibble per tree) that can be
  unnested for comparison.

- keep_model_id:

  Logical. If \`TRUE\`, include a \`vol_model\` column with the engine
  function name used.

## Value

If \`pick_best = TRUE\`, a tibble with one row per tree and columns:
\`vol_total\`, \`vol_merchantable\`, and optionally \`vol_model\`.

If \`pick_best = FALSE\`, a list (suitable for use as a list-column in
\`dplyr::mutate()\`) with one element per tree. Each element is a tibble
of candidate model outputs (\`vol_total\`, \`vol_merchantable\`, and
optionally \`vol_model\`).

## Model selection logic

Model selection is driven by the model registry and occurs per input
tree:

1.  Geographic applicability: models are filtered to those whose
    \`province_scope\` includes the provided \`jurisdiction\` (or
    \`"ALL"\`).

2.  Species coverage: models are filtered to those that include the
    provided \`species\` in their parameter tables. Some models may
    include genus/group codes (e.g., \`"PICE.SPP"\`); these are treated
    as covering all matching species within that genus/group.

3.  Required inputs: models that require total height are excluded when
    \`height\` is missing. Models that require a subregion (e.g., BEC
    zone for certain provincial models) are excluded when \`subregion\`
    is missing.

4.  Model ranking: if multiple eligible models remain, \`pick_best =
    TRUE\` selects the highest-ranked model (\`rank\`) for each tree.

## Fallback behavior

Availability is evaluated at the species level, not only by
jurisdiction. This means a regional/provincial model may exist for a
jurisdiction but may not include coefficients for the provided species.
In such cases, \`vol()\` automatically falls back to another eligible
model (e.g., a multi-province regional model or a national model) that
\*does\* cover the species and required inputs.

## Important limitations and recommended use

- This is an automatic wrapper. Because selection is registry-driven,
  \`vol()\` may use a model that is not the one you intended (e.g., a
  national model instead of a regional model, or a different regional
  model than you expected), especially when the preferred model is not
  available for the input species or missing required inputs.

- Model outputs differ. Different models will generally return slightly
  different volume estimates for the same DBH/height/species due to
  differences in model form, fitted data, geographic scope, and
  merchantability assumptions. These differences are expected.

- If you require a specific model, do not use \`vol()\`. Instead, call
  the relevant model function directly (e.g., \`vol_huang94()\`,
  \`vol_kozak94()\`, \`vol_ung2013()\`, etc.) to ensure full control and
  reproducibility.

- Investigate before operational use. It is strongly recommended to run
  \`vol()\` with \`pick_best = FALSE\` during exploratory analyses to
  inspect which models are eligible and how sensitive results are to
  model choice. When \`pick_best = FALSE\`, \`vol()\` returns a
  list-column (one element per tree) containing a tibble of candidate
  model outputs; this can be unnested to compare models.

## Examples
